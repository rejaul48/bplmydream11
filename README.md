**BPL - My Dream11** is a React-based player management tool enabling users to select, manage, and remove players with real-time credit tracking, notifications, and user-friendly controls for efficient selection.

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to manage a virtual player selection process. Users can add players, remove players, and manage credit balances while receiving real-time feedback and notifications on their actions. The application is designed to make the selection process seamless and user-friendly, providing alerts for available credits, maximum player limits, and duplicate player selections.

## Feature

     choices. <br>
💰**Credit Tracking and Management:** The application displays the user’s available credits, allowing for instant feedback when credits are updated after player selections.<br>
⚠️**Duplicate Player Alert:** The tool prevents users from selecting the same player multiple times, providing immediate notifications if they attempt to do so.<br>
🚫**Player Limit Enforcement:** Users receive warnings when trying to exceed the maximum player limit (six players), enhancing the selection experience through real-time validation.<br>
